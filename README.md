Got it! Here’s a streamlined README template without any code, focusing on the project overview, dataset, and other essential details.

English to Punjabi Machine Translation Transformer Model
Overview
This repository contains resources for an English-to-Punjabi machine translation model. The model leverages the ai4bharat/IndicNER tokenizer for Punjabi sentences and the bert-base-uncased tokenizer for English sentences, built using TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers library.

Dataset
The dataset used for training this model consists of 155,000 English sentences with corresponding Punjabi translations. You can find the dataset here.

Data Format
Ensure the dataset is in the following format:

English Sentence	Punjabi Sentence
Hello	ਸਤ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ
How are you?	ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਵੇਂ ਹੋ?
...	...
Training
The model uses two separate tokenizers:

bert-base-uncased for English sentences.
ai4bharat/IndicNER for Punjabi sentences.
Ensure to split the dataset into training and testing sets appropriately, maintaining a good balance between the two for effective training and evaluation.

Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset. Track metrics such as accuracy, loss, and any other relevant metrics to assess the model's performance.

Deployment
Will soon deploy the model for usage
